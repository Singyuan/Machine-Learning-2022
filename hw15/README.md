# HW 15 - Meta Learning
**Just run jupyter notebook on Colab pro+.**
## The method I used to pass the strong baselines includes
1. I used 'original MAML' algorithm.
2. Increasing val_inner_train_step.
3. Increasing epoch.

## Appendix
1. dev accuracy v.s. the number of tasks
2. dev accuracy v.s. inner update step at inference
